find var1: bool
such that {} != {{0}, {-3, 6}}
such that (-8 != 2) = var1 \/ false /\ 0 != -10
such that {-1} != {-10} \/ (true \/ false -> -5 = -5)
such that toInt(var1) != 8
such that true
such that false
such that true



int
set of int




Say we  have
s set of bool

we want
 matrix [int(1..3)] of int


|s|
[ |s|, |s|, |s| ]




[3, 5; int(9, 8..9)],
