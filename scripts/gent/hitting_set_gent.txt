So suppose you have a minimal hitting set {x,y,z…}  I know in all our
cases the size is at most 2 but the idea is general.

Take the first element x.   Now find all winning sets containing x.   Take
the intersection of these sets.   Call this set X = {x,x1,x2…}.  It is
guaranteed that X is non empty because x in X.

Then do the same for y, and z etc...

Report the set {X,Y,Z,…} or if you prefer the set X Union Y Union Z …

Note that for all xi in X, it is guaranteed that xi not in Y.  Because
otherwise {xi,z,…} would be a smaller hitting set.

(Now I get less sure)

I think there is a nice characterisation of what this produces.

Note that for all xi,xj in X, there is no instance where model xi
dominates xj

While for xi in X, yj in Y, there IS an instance where xi dominates yj,
and a second instance where yj dominates xi.

(not true)
So I think the set S = X U Y U Z … has the properties that

+ For all a,b in S, either there is no instance where either a dominates b
or b dominates a, or there are instances where a dominates b and b
dominates a.

+ For all c not in S, there is a model a such that there is an instance
where a dominates c, and no instance where c dominates a.

I¹m not 100% sure about this characterisation but either way I think the
hitting set thing until I said "Now I get less sure" is good.  But as IanM
said, if we do not have time to do this we can still submit the paper
