idea of makes a essence spec which can find instances which is close to another instance.

This is done by giving the previous instance to the spec as well as a radius for each variable and adding a constraints to limit the radius


pppec  -  ppp using ecild distance for each var
pppec_max_dist - finds the maximum exlid distance from an instance.

org.solution a instance found for org.oessence


the dist vars should include zero in their domains
