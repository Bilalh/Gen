      Title: | Stress testing of task deadlines: A constraint programming approach
      Authors: | Di Alesio S, Nejati S, Briand L, et al.
      Where: | IEEE Xplore 2013 pp. 158-167
      Notes: |   #tex
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Compares CP with GAs for the purpose of test case generation for Real Time Embedded Systems (RT-ESs)
          
          \item The whole problem of test generation is one CP search problem. This would not work for Essence expressions since they are 
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Infinitely large
            \item we do not have a specifying max number of test failures as an objective.
          \end{enumerate}
          
          \item Concludes that CP is more Effective then GA for test generation of Schedules that might find bugs 
        \end{itemize}

      Title: | Using CP in Automatic Test Generation for ABB Roboticsâ€™ Paint Control System
      Authors: | Mossige M, Gotlieb A, and Meling H
      Where: | Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming 2014 pp. 25-41
      Notes: 
        -  Test generation for a specific problem
        - "a less accurate but faster test will always be preferred over a slow but accurate test"
        -  They found a api to be more useful then spec language.
        -  They made a python interface so the users to abstract way some of the CP
