total function

say

n_upper 12
n_boats 6
n_periods 8


capacity  total function int(1..6)  --> int(1..12)


since the function is total could use a bit string


What does it mean for a a function to be in radius of another?
possible ideas
	- treat the whole number as a bit string
	    Could work but will not work for nested types
	    also might not be representative

	- treat each value  as a separate dimension
		means that won't be much influence until there a lot of points
		also what to do about function with different domain/range sizes?

	- Euclidean distance
