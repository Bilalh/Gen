$ Number of nodes
given N : int(1..20)
letting num_nodes be domain int(1..N)

$ Directed edges, (a,b) means a depends on the value of b.
given Edges : set ( maxSize (N * (N-1)) / 2 ) of (num_nodes, num_nodes)

$ The generation order indexed by the node id
$
find ordering : function(total) num_nodes --> num_nodes

such that
	$ Nodes that are depend on are placed first
	forAll (fro,to) in Edges .
		ordering(to) < ordering(fro)


minimising max(range(ordering))
